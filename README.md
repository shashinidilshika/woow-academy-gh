As 4th year Research Project module we have to do a research and come up with a software solution for that research problem. So that we develop a woow-accademy web application.

<p>In the competitive job market, verifying qualifications and skills in candidates' CVs can be challenging. To address this issue, we've pioneered an innovative assessment method.Our central objective of this research is to provide a fair and robust evaluation of a candidate's English language proficiency, fluency, and their overall skill set. There are four main sub objectives in this research such as  English language proficiency test matching, Skill proficiency test matching, Leaderboard generation, Cv generation. furethermore we are use  NLP (natural language processing), ML (machine learning)for this research.This pioneering approach aims to offer employers a more dependable and comprehensive means of gauging the qualifications and capabilities of job applicants, ultimately streamlining the hiring process and ensuring the selection of the most qualified candidates for the job.
